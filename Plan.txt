We are writing a rock, papers and scissors game to be played at the console of a browser.
for that, we need to prompt the player with 3 choices(rock, paper or scissors). After that, get the player input.
Then, we need a function that randomly gets one of the three choices to be the computers choice. After that, we need to compare
the two choices(computer and user), and them output the result, which can be one of three: winner, looser or draw.

SUBROUTINE getComputerChoice():
            SET min = rounded min value(0)
            SET max = rounded mx value(2)
            CALL random method, multiply by (max - min + 1) + min
            SET choice as the result of calculation
            RETURN computerChoice
        END SUBROUTINE

        SUBROUTINE getHumanChoice():
            CREATE choice variable
            PROMPT the user with the choices
            STORE the user choice in playerInput
            CASE playerInput === 'rock' 
                SET choice to 0;
            CASE playerInput === 'paper' 
                SET choice to 1;
            CASE playerInput === 'scissors' 
                SET choice to 2;
            DEFAULT
                return -1    
            RETURN humanChoice;
        END SUBROUTINE

SUBROUTINE  sleep(miliseconds) 
    CREATE new promise object promise(resolve{CALL setTimeout method(resolve, miliseconds)}) 
END SUBROUTINE           

SUBROUTINE playGame  
    CREATE humanScore variable to hold the humanScore
    CREATE computerScore variable to hold the humanScore
    SET humanScore to 0
    SET computerScore to 0

    SUBROUTINE playRound(computerChoice, humanChoice):
        IF humanChoice === -1
            SHOW error message 'input not valid, please enter a valid choice'
            RETURN
        ELSE IF humanChoice === computerChoice
            SHOW draw message "Its a draw!  
        ELSE IF (humanChoice === 0 AND computerChoice === 2 OR 
                humanChoice === 1 AND computerChoice === 0 OR
                humanChoice === 2 AND computerChoice === 1)
                SHOW "you win " message
                humanScore ++
        ELSE
            SHOW "Computer wins' message   
            computerScore ++
    END SUBROUTINE        

    WHILE humanScore <= 5 OR computerScore <=5:
        SET computerChoice to the return value of getComputerChoice
        SET humanChoice to the return value of getHumanChoice
        CALL playRound(computerChoice, humanChoice)
        CALL sleep(2000) function then continue
